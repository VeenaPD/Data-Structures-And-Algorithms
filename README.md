# Data Structures And Algorithms

This repository consists of Beginner to Intermediate level Data structures and Algorithms problems with solutions solved in `Javascript` language.

## Common setup

- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Open terminal and type `--version` or `--v` to make sure node is installed successfully
- Download zip file and unzip folder
- Open project in your favorite IDE
- Open terminal type the `node filename` click enter to execute the problem. Ex: `node array-strings/reverse-string.js`

## Explaination on Data structures and algorithms

## Data structures

A **data structure** is a particular way of organising data in a computer so that it can be used effectively and to be processed in an efficient time and space.

### Types of Data structures

Data structures can be divided into two categories, they are as follows:
1. **Primitive data structures**: Primitive data is not an object and has no methods. 
  There are 7 primitive data types in Javascript:
  * Number
  * String
  * Boolean
  * Undefined
  * Null
  * Bigint
  * Symbol

2. **Non-primitive data structures**: This is further divided as follows:
* Physical Data structures: Arrays, Linkedlist
* Logical Data structures: Graphs, Tree, Hashing, Stack, Queue, etc

## Algorithms

An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

### List of Algorithms

1. Greedy Algorithm
2. Divide and Conquer
3. Dynamic programming
